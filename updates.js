'<p>05.01.2020 - I\'ve been rather lax about updating here. Well, life got in the way of a lot of my creativity for a while and we\'ll leave it at that. I\'ve been rather busy helping out with the Avrae Discord Bot as well. However! New on Monday May 4th, The Ravager class will be releasing on the DM\'s Guild, along with another supplement to follow the next week. So keep your eyes open!</p>',
'<p>12.21.2018 - Lots of things to update on. My HDD died on me a little more than a week after I posted the last update and it took some time to get that situation sorted out. BUT it was sorted out and I got all my data back, so I\'ve been working hard on <i>The Carnival Compendium</i>, which now contains one new subclass for each of the PHB classes, rules for 20 carnival games, and so much more. Estimated release date for that is Spring of 2019 now. In the meantime, Solstice Shenanigans has been updated with a new cover, some additional interior art, corrections, clarifications, and printable paper minis! And it joined the ranks of the Gold best sellers on the DM\'s guild just a few days ago!',
'<p>8.29.2018 - Oops. I haven\'t updated here in forever. So, I participated in a DM Jam for the DM\'s Guild. My adventure took second place. You can find the compilation of all the entries <a href="https://www.dmsguild.com/product/247390">here</a>! All proceeds go towards funding future DM Jams. Meanwhile, coming soon is <i>The Carnival Collection</i>, with 6 new subclasses, rules for a bunch of carnival games, some D&D inspired carnival food, and an adventure set in a carnival!</p>',
'<p>5.16.2018 - I haven\'t posted any updates here in a while, I\'ve been busy working on a few projects. I just finished one up and released it on the DM\'s Guild today! <a href="http://bit.ly/BitesBurnsBlackMagic">Bites, Burns & Black Magi</a> presents a trio of Bard College options for your entertainment! The College of Serpents has a focus on poisons and charms, the College of Souls can raise the dead to fight for them, and the College of Zingers uses their words as weapons to turn their enemies\'s attacks and even magic against them. I\'m still working on another non-generator project at the moment, but I\'ll try to remember to share more updates here! And I should really fix some things with the site and navigation...</p>',
'<p>4.18.2018 - A <a href="http://bit.ly/TCSx2FullSheet">full-sized version of TCSx2</a> is now available on the DM\'s Guild. Check it out!</p>',
'<p>4.11.2018 - <a href="http://bit.ly/TCSx2Sheet">TCSx2</a> has undergone several revisions with the help of many wonderfully helpful members of the Twitter D&D community to help ensure the color-coded version is distinguishable for everyone. Coming soon will be a standard-sized version of the sheet for those who prefer the traditional size character sheet, but still want something unique. That version will also be pay-what-you-want. Go check out the pocket-sized and let me know what you think!</p>',
'<p>4.03.2018 - <a href="http://bit.ly/TCSx2Sheet">TCSx2</a> is out on the DM\'s Guild. It will still be receiving some updates and edits, but it\'s there if you want to check it out!</p>',
'<p>4.02.2018 - Coming VERY soon, like in a few hours soon, I\'ll be releasing a Textless 3x5 Character Sheet on the DM\'s Guild. Also fixed a few bugs in the Taverns script, and fixed a few minor HTML errors that weren\'t causing any problems, but weren\'t right.</p>',
'<p>3.27.2018 - It\'s been too long away. Sort of getting back into it. Cleaned up a couple things, added a few little bits here and there, and added in a birthday-present cameo for a friend.</p>',
'<p>3.03.2018 again - Fixed more spelling errors, reworked the naming a bit and removed a while statement that might have been causing problems. Added in some chances for a few special tavern names. Also tried to fix a bug that\'s causing some users to get stuck with an enlarged white box but no tavern generated. Think it has to do with the automatic scrolling, so playing around with that.</p><p>3.03.2018 - Bug fixes, spelling corrections, more interconnection between elements, and more chance for alliterative names. And while I was adding the extra chance for consonnance, I noticed that I had the object half of the name only including up to the descriptor array length in possibilities, so now there should be a lot more possibilities showing up. It was cutting off a lot of montsers. Also, @TooFadedGaming won the secret contest and now has a character making a cameo in NATG!</p>',
'<p>3.02.2018 - A few minor bug fixes, and other little things. The secret contest is still ongoing. Tweet at me and mention the updates and you\'ll get a cameo for one of your D&D or other RPG characters in NATG!</p>',
'<p>3.01.2018 - Well, it\'s technically the 2nd already, but I started working on the update over 12 hours ago. Anyway, Starters are in. A few more things got added to a few lists. And a lot of organizational, backend stuff got worked on. I worked a bit on the pricing formulas, but I think they still need work. As I said, I think it\'s time to take a break from this and work on other stuff. My secret contest is still ongoing though, if you\'re the first one to tweet at me and tell me your read one of these updates, you will get a character cameo in NATG! Oh, and I did some research into things and I highly doubt I\'ll ever create it as an iPhone app unless there proves to be tons of interest in that and I do a kickstarter to fund it. I will be figuring out how to turn it into an Android app for sure eventually though. It needs quite a bit of cleanup still though. So, while I\'m, working on art projects, I hope you all have fun with NATG and let me know if you find any bugs! Thanks!</p>',
'<p>2.27.2018 - Got Soups and Salads in. Still need to finalize the formulas for the prices on the soups and salads, they are way off at some of the lifestyles right now. Once I get everything done I will go back and unify all the price finding formulas and it will be more consistent throughout. All that\'s left now are the Starters, then I\'ll be taking a short break from this all before diving back in to clean things up and add more things as I think of them. In the meantime, I\'ll be working on some Critical Role fan art as a break from staring at code. After the break and the cleanup, then it\'s on to the Travelers half of Taverns & Travelers. And I\'m still offering a cameo in NATG to the first person to tweet at me and say they read my updates. And speaking of updates, I added the ability to see a few of the more interesting tables without having to parse through code. It\'s all shaping up nicely and I should have it ready to be called Beta by the end of the week. Eventually I\' be looking into how to port it over to an android or iphone app, but that\'s a bit further out into the future yet.</p>',
'<p>2.26.2018 - Updated the updates page to look nicer, now it\'s not a wall of text and you can navigate through the updates. Might add another option to view all, but whatever for now. I doubt anyone is looking at these anyway. First person to prove me wrong and mention this in a tweet @me gets a cameo appearance for one of their characters in the generator somewhere. Also added a lot of backend stuff and fixed up some formulas. Added interconnectedness between the accommodations and the owner secrets, but you have to regenerate the accommodations manually if you regenerate the tavern\'s tale on its own. Might code in a way to do it automatically eventually, but for now I\'m fine with it as is. Also added the possibility for meat to have gone off or be improperly cooked. A few other minors things too. Cleaned up the restrictive buttons a bit, added the scroll back to top on a full regeneration, added a few more name possibilities, probably other stuff too.</p>',
'<p>2.25.2018 again - Added some radio buttons so you can restrict a few of the options. If you\'re on the prowl for a raucous dive bar, you\'ll have much better luck finding one!</p>',
'<p>2.25.2018 - Added the Hard Drinks and Entrees. Hard Drinks still need a bit more work to make them final, but they\'re there for now. Pretty happy with how the entrees turned out though. And thankfully I didn\'t lose everything I did today when my editor crashed and came back with a blank .js file. I think I must have tried to save at the same time the GitHub app was doing a fetch and it ended up wiping the file. So thankfully I had it open in chrome and was able to dig it out of the cache. Was rather anxiety-inducing when I thought I lost everything I did today and I was about to just say F it to having menus at all since I didn\'t want to have to do it all over. But yeah, they\'re in, it was recovered. We\'re good. Oh, and I added a chance for the wine to be poisoned. I\'ll probably add some things like that to the food stuffs as well, but for now, it\'s just the wine. I did add an eating challenge that will come up if that\'s the tavern\'s draw as well.</p>',
'<p>2.24.3018 - Had a chance to do a few things today. Played with the ABV formula, the Lagers and Ales should be much more believably potent for the technology level of most fantasy settings. Changed some style things, should be a little more friendly on phones now. Fixed things with the printing/saving process a bit. It still says it times out, but at least now it\'s not trying to print buttons and it includes all the sections now (I had missed including the accommodations section when I added it). And because I couldn\'t stand having it on the site without being at least somewhat usable, I started working on the Traveler Generator. It provides a very random, very brief physical description now. It\'ll be much more in-depth eventually, but at least it\'s there now. And I had a little more time, so I added prices for wine by the glass and beer by the pint too.</p>',
'<p>2.23.2018 - Apparently I lied yesterday, I got a chance to work on it for a couple hours today. So I removed the buttons from the bottom, now you can click on the headings of each section to regenerate the section instead of having to scroll down to the bottom. Did some other minor things too, but it was mostly the reworking of the buttons.</p>',
'<p>2.22.2018 - Futzed with a bunch of formulas to make some relationships work better. Still need to revise some of them, I think some variables aren\'t showing up currently. Some of my math is off. I\'ll fix it soon<sup>TM</sup>. But I got the Lagers & Ales in. Mostly happy with how they\'re working, think I need to revise a few of the formulas, but I\'m not coming up with any that are too unbelievable. I\'m sure a beer snob would say otherwise, but I think it\'s good enough for now. I want to get to the food! I have so many ideas. Oh, right, and I added the ability to export a plain text pdf for any tavern you like. And I sort of fixed the renaming, but I lost the eponymous alcohols. Worth the trade-off I think. Probably won\'t get another chance to really work on things until Sunday. And I really need to learn how to make these multiple pages or something. I\'m going to make this page too long.</p>',
'<p>2.21.2018 - Didn\'t get to do much today, just fixed a few things with the wine list and changed the formula for determining the prices, still think it\'s not quite right, but it\'s close enough for now.</p>',
'<p>2.20.2018 - Started working on the drinks. Did a lot of work on the backend so that several aspects are now based on the quality of the tavern. Wines are <i>mostly</i> done, still need to do the beers and hard alcohols. Then I\'ll move onto the foodstuffs, and then work on other details that will get added back in to the other sections.</p>',
'<p>2.19.2018 - Worked a lot on the Tavern Generator. It now generates bartenders and clientele, including patron activities and a few adventure hooks. Also broke up the functions to make it easier and then that allowed me to add individual buttons to allow for rerolling just parts of the tavern. It\'s coming along pretty well.</p>',
'<p>2.18.2018 - Worked more on the Tavern Generator. Added more possibilities and changed how a few things were being figured out. Should be even easier to add new things in the future now. Also, I should really set this update page up like a wordpress thing so it doesn\'t eventually become just one huge long page of updates...</p>',
'<p>2.17.2018 - Worked a bit on the Tavern Generator, mostly cleaning up the formulas to make things easier in the future. Added automated math to show how many possibilities there are. Also added more possibilities.</p>',
'<p>2.14.18 - Added an actual adventures page instead of just linking to my DM\'s Guild author page. Still need to make it actually work properly, right now it\'s wonky, but hey, I\'m reteaching myself HTML after not really doing much with it for a long time.</p>',
'<p>2.13.18 - The alpha version of the website is up with a very sparse tavern generator included. <a href="http://bit.ly/OS-LoveBites">Love Bites</a> has over 200 downloads and is still pay-what-you-want for Valentine\'s Day. Pick it up and surprise your significant other with an adventure of love! The traveler generator will be along soon<sup>TM</sup>. Dirge\'s D&D Dollar Dreadfuls, a series of loosely connected short adventures, is in production and the first one will be out in the Spring. Several other projects are on the backburner; more details will get pushed out about those once everything solidifies a bit more.</p>'
